This is a project I and a friend worked on several years ago.  It was a file syncing srevice written in Java.

I don't actively support it, but I did learn a few neat things while working on it.  It does sync files on a local disk quite well, and there is a basic structure for AWS syncing, but nothing functional.

It did, however, provide the basis for a somewhat popular JavaFX demo I've written.  See my java-fx node link demo project for more details.
